# Alert Banners

## Introduction

Provides alert banners that can be placed sitewide or on selected pages. A part of the LocalGovDrupal distribution.

The module provides one predefined banner type named Alert banner, with four alert types: 

* Announcement
* Minor Alert
* Major Alert
* Death of a notable person

Visitors can close individual alert banners, thereby preventing the banners from being displayed again. 

Editors can create and manage one or more banners, and choose which are displayed at any given time and on which pages.

Administrators can create additional banner types, and configure the alert types for each one. (See [Basic Configuration](technical.html#basic-configuration))

## Examples
* [LocalGov Drupal demo](https://demo.localgovdrupal.org/): features two **Death of a notable person alerts**, and a **Minor alert**

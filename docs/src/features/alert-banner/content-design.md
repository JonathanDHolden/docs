## When to use an Alert Banner

Use an alert banner to display a message to users at the top of all pages, or a set of pages. Select the type of alert that best reflects the nature and urgency of the message, for example:

## Publishing options

### Live status
Alert Banners are only visible on the site when they are set live in the banner's Publishing options. When setting a banner live you will be shown a preview of the banner, and given the option to unpublish all other Alert Banners (use with care).

A live Alert Banner can be turned off by checking the Remove box in its Publishing options.

### Display title
You can choose whether the Alert Banner title is displayed. For example this Alert Banner has no visible title, instead formatting the short description to emphasise some text:

### Remove hide button
The Hide button allows users to dismiss an Alert Banner so that it is not shown again. You can choose not to display this button and effectively force the banner to awlays display with the Remove hide button checkbox in the Publishing options.

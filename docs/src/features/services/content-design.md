## Service landing page

### When to use a service landing page
Use a service landing page for the homepage of a section. For example:

* [Adult social care (on LGD demo site)](https://localgovdrupal.agile.coop/adult-health-and-social-care)
* [Children, young people and families (on Croydon)](https://www.croydon.gov.uk/children-young-people-and-families)
<!-- Where shall we link to? -->
<!-- Todo: add screenshots -->

The service landing page will be linked to from the homepage of the website.

### Provide a summary
Your summary should provide more information than what the title suggests. It should include what a user can do and find out in the section. Read the [guidance on summaries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk#summaries).

***Example:*** 

*Title: Rubbish and recycling*

*Summary: Household recycling and rubbish collection service and collection times, what you can recycle, how to report a problem, and street cleaning.*

<!-- Is this general advice we want to give?  -->
### Grouping sections
You should only display no more than 9 sections on a landing page. This is because more than 9 is hard to navigate on mobile, as the sections stack on top of each other.

You should group content by topics.

***Example:*** 
*See how the sections are grouped in the business section.*

### Using call to action buttons on landing page

Call to action (CTA) buttons allow quick access to high priority tasks within a section.

Engage with the service to understand what the top task are within a section and use analytics to see what pages users engage with most. Monitor this over time and change it according to users' needs.

***Example:*** 
*See the 'Report a concern about a child' CTA in the Children, young people and families section.*

### Number of CTAs per landing page
<!-- Is this general advice? -->
You should only have 3 call to action buttons at a maximum on a landing page – having more than this pushes the sections further down the page on mobile.

If there's a user need to temporarily give quick access to important content, for example coronavirus information, you could add another in this situation, or remove one of the existing CTAs.

## Service sub-landing pages

### When to use a service sub landing page
Service sub landing pages are index pages that link out to other pages. They usually sit a level below the main service page. Think of them as chapters of a book, giving the user the option to browse everything in that section.

You can use them to link to:

* step-by-step pages
* guide pages
* service pages
* campaign pages

They automatically pull in the title and the summary of the page they're linking to.

***Example:*** 

*Examples include:*

- *marriages and civil partnerships*
- *travel support*
- *births*

Sub-landing pages can be grouped by topic. The list of links will have subheadings. If you want to use topics that are used in other services you can add this, the subheaded section will include a more link to another page with a list of all content in those topics from all services.

<!-- Add links to examples or demo site -->

## Service pages

### When to use a service page
Service pages are the most commonly used type of page, they're useful if you're creating content that:

* addresses one user need or task
* is relatively brief
* can fit on one single page
* links out to an online form

If the page requires more guidance or information
You will need to consider using either:

* guidance pages – if there's more content that's relative to the user completing the task, but it doesn't follow a strict process, for example types of animal welfare licences
* step by step pages – if the guidance follows a sequential process, for example registering a death: step by step

<!-- Todo: update links once there's documentation for guides etc -->

***Examples***

*Examples include:*

* *correcting a death registration*
* *the London taxicard*
* *Shopmobility*

### Adding a call to action button to a Service page
<!-- todo: test this -->
Service pages can be used for start now pages. These are pages where users start their journey to completing a task.

You can add a call to action button at the top of the service page by adding a link to the 'Task' tab on the righthand side menu of the page editor.

You should also call the button 'Start now', unless there's more than one task button.

See the start now pattern for more details.

***Examples***

*These include:*
* *Find a school near you*
* *Find support for families, children and young people*

# News Feature 

aka (localgov_news)

## Purpose
Provides the pages and navigation for presenting news articles. An optional part of the LocalGovDrupal distribution.

## Overview
When you enable this feature you will get:
* News article content type
* Newsroom content type
* News editor role

A single Newsroom is created on installation, which will list all News Articles by default. There will be up to three “featured” News articles listed at the top of the page. 

The Newsroom page will display a search and filters block, allowing end-users to filter the list of news by date and category.

If multiple Newsrooms are created the editor will be given the option to choose to associate an article with a single Newsroom.

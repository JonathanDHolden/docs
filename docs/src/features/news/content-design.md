## Newsroom

When the feature is enabled, a piece of content of the type Newsroom is created, with the title News, and the URL /news

By default, this will list any News Articles that you add, and present you with a search widget. 

News Articles will be presented in descending date order, however there is a feature to promote up to three items per Newsroom. 

### Creating an additional Newsroom

You may add an additional Newsroom - for example if you wanted a section within the site for news for a specific Service or subject matter. 

When you create a new Newsroom, there will be an additional field shown on the News Article to determine which Newsroom a News Article belongs to.

# Taxonomy vocabularies and terms

Microsites all have the same taxonomy vocabularies, but each site can have a unique set of terms. 

The vocabularies available on microsites are: 
- Tags / Categories: Categorise news articles and blog posts. 
- Blog author: Blog authors for blog posts.
- Event category: Category used for filtering events.
- Event price: Price used for filtering events.
- Event neighbourhood: Locality used for event filtering.

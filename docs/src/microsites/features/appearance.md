# Appearance

Microsite admins have the permission to set a number of appearance variables through the UI. With this and the flexible layout options it is possible to create sites with very differnent look and feel. 

We recommend consulting a designer. We hope to create useful documentation for designers, and would value input from designers about what would be helpful in this area.

## General settings

Through the Site design panel, choose the General settings tab. 

Theoretically you can just set up the styles in this panel for a good looking site, however in practice you may like to override more components for more granular control. 

**Fonts**: we've offered a limited set of fonts, which are stored locally so that we don't run in to problems with GDPR (@todo add link). If you'd like to use another font please see the section on adding a custom theme. 

**Colours**: the fields for setting colours allow HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL, color names in the text input. The colour picker field is there to help but only allows / reflects HEX values. If you enter the colour value in HEX you will see the colour swatch, and the outline change in the field. 


**Accent 1 / Accent 1 contrast** : these colours are used together and should meet colour contrast standards. By default accent 1 affects the following

- Header bacground / text colour
- Footer background / text colour
- Active element* highlights
- Background colour accent 1 (on a page_section - todo add link )

**Accent 2 / Accent 2 contrast**: these colours are used together and should meet colour contrast standards. By default Accent 2 affects the following:

- Preheader background / text colour
- Inactive element highlights
- Backgrounf colour accent 2 (on a page_section - todo add link )

**Text colour**: the main body text and heading colour

**Fonts**: we've offered a limited set of fonts, which are stored locally so that we don't run in to problems with GDPR (@todo add link). If you'd like to use another font please see the section on adding a custom theme.

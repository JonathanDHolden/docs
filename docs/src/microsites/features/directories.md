# Directories

Directories provide a way for editors to present content as a list which can be searched and filtered by end-users. 

This feature can be enabled (or disabled) on a microsite by the site's Microsite admin. 

There are three types of content available out-of-the-box:
- Directory page
- Directory venue
- Directory promo page

With these it is possible to create directories for all sorts of things, for example:
- information and help
- local services 
- venues
- stalls in a Christmas market

<!--@todo add screenshots and links to examples -->

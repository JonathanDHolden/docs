See [Roles](/microsites/roles.md)

Requirements

 - Log in to the microsite on its unique domain. 

1. Visit Invitations
1. Click "Invite member"
1. Enter the email address, if you want them to be a Microsite admin, check the box. 
1. Save

### Invitation workflow (new user)

1. [Microsite admin] Send an invite
1. [New user] Receive an email to set up an account
1. [New user] Set up new account on the website via email link
1. [New user] Receive an email to accept invitation
1. [New user] Accept invitation on the website via email link

Note: Microsite members are assigned/unassigned the "Trusted editor" Drupal role automatically.

### Invitation workflow (exisiting user)

If someone already exists on the control site (they may be a member of another microsite already), they will skip steps 2 & 3 above.

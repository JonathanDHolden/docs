# Find your way around

## Logging in and out

Read [How to log in](/content/how-to/how-to-log-in.html).

Note: you may have a single username and password to all the microsites (on a single control site) you are a member of. 

## Control site

Use the control site only for central operations, such as creating and deleting microsites. We do not recommend editing mictosite content etc from the control site, as things can get confusing!

## Microsite 

### Microsite administration menu

The **Microsite administration menu** shows the administration tasks required to manage your site.

Note: the above items are available for Microsite admins, a Microsite editor has fewer items available. 

You can access the microsite administration menu from the main admin toolbar.

If this is hidden, toggle the "Manage" menu item to reveal it.

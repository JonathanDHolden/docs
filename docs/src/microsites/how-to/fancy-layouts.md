# How to build fancy layouts

Most page types have a Layouts and rich content field, which allows for multi-column layouts and many content components. 

Within this field you may add one or more page sections. This page section can have 1, 2 or 3 columns. This page section can have a background colour, width and padding set to create stand out sections. 

A page section can then have one or more paragraphs or content sections added to it. 

## Duplicate

You can duplicate page sections, or individial paragraphs to save time. 

## Drag and drop interface

Page sections or content sections can be moved around using a pointing device (eg mouse) or the arrow keys on the keyboard. 


## Content sections

The content sections are borrowed heavily from localgov_subsites and localgov_paragraphs.

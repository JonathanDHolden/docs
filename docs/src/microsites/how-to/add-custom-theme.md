# How to add a custom theme

Each microsite can have an entirely custom theme. 

We recommend creating a child theme of localgov_microsites_base, which is itself a child of localgov_base. 

See the localgov_microsite_base README for more details. 

Once the new theme is ready, a developer will need to deploy and install the theme through the Appearance UI of the control site. 

Once the theme is installed it will be available to Microsite Admins in the Site settings tab of the microsite.

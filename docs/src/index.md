LocalGov Drupal is an open source collaboration between UK councils and Drupal developers.

Our aim is to provide a better publishing platform built on Drupal to save time, save money and to generate mutual benefit from pooling our knowledge and resources. [Read more on the main site](https://localgovdrupal.org).

Here you can find all the documentation for LocalGov Drupal, from installation to configuration, theming and using the content types.

# Javascript

## Deprecated

<span style="color:#B30000;">**This documentation is for the original localgov_theme and the associated localgov_skeleton theme, which have been superceded by the [localgov_base theme](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov_base) documentation for which is in production.**</span>

Currently Javascript is not being compiled or handled in anyway by Gulp so it's up to you how you structure your code. Code can be found in `/assets/js` and there is a mix of examples including jQuery and using Drupal behaviors.

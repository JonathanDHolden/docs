# How to contribute

We're always looking for people to contribute and improve LocalGov Drupal. Here are some easy ways to get involved:

- **Developers:** contribute code, issue reports, bugfixes, test pull requests and documentation. Make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/blob/2.x/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you'd like to get involved then [check out the issue queue on Github](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/issues) or [View our public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/localgovdrupal/projects/31).  
- **Front-end developers and designers:** join our #group-frontend channel on Slack and [log frontend issues in Github](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/issues/new) 
- **Content designers:** Join our regular [Content Group Meetups](https://lu.ma/session-5beph1ql8l2jytwhmzix), the best place to get help and support.
- **Service designers:** Join our #group-user-research channel on Slack and share your user research and documentation with us. We collate these for other councils to benefit from.

Every contribution is valuable. If you are not sure where to start then email community@localgovdrupal.org or [book a call with Aaron, our Community Lead](https://cal.com/localgovdrupal-community/aaron-45mins).

## Help us improve our documentation

Writing and testing our documentation is very helpful to everyone. On every page you will find a link to "Help us improve this page" that takes you to an editable page in markdown, so you can quickly open a pull request (PR) on GitHub to make any changes.

If you want to get setup locally, the [README](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/docs/blob/master/README.md) is the best place to start. Then open a PR with your changes, every PR will get tested and show you a preview automatically.

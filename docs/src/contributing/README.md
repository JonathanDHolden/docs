# Getting involved!

We're very excited to have you interested in this project and there are many venues of involvement you can have. Make sure you read the [contribution guidelines]().

1. Share our project with your colleagues and your social media

2. Start using our project and contribute back

3. [View our public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/6vuzkqZa/localgov-drupal-public-roadmap)

ðŸ‘ˆ You can also view one of the specific areas from the sidebar.

## Communication

You can join our Slack group if you have any questions or want to jump into discussions.

Code of conduct coming soon...

## Documentation

Writing and testing our documentation is very helpful to maintainers. On every page you will find a link to "Help us improve this page" that takes you to an editable page in markdown, so you can quickly open a pull request (PR) on GitHub to make any changes.

If you want to get setup locally, the [README](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/docs/blob/master/README.md) is the best place to start. Then you can just open a PR with your changes, every PR will get tested and show you a preview automatically.

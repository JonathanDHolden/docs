# Hosting a LocalGov Drupal site

There are lots of options for hosting a Drupal site in general and a LocalGov Drupal site is generally no different.

For most council sites, it is considered best practice to have a three tiered approach. 

 - Development site
 - Staging / testing site
 - Production site

## Development site

This is where developers can deploy changes to code and configuration to review the functionaity and styling of the site and resolve any bugs before 

## Staging site

Once work is reaady to be deployed the developers use the staging site test the deployment against a copy of the production database and files. 
Ideally the staging site should be identical to the produciton site with any additional performance and security configurations to support full testing.

## Production site

This is the live public facing site where content designers manage live content and the public can access and interact with content and funcionality.

## Hosting providors and options

Councils hosting with LocalGov Drupal use a range of providors and hosting technologies and we are not in a position to recommend one over another. 
It might be usful to talk with other councils about their experience hosting LocalGov Drupal. 

### Croydon Council

Croydon Council manage their hosting on the Microsoft Azure platform. There is some usful discussion of that on this Github issue: https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/issues/497 

### Brighton and Hove City Council

Brighton and Hove City Council use the Acquia Cloud platform to host their main public facing site.

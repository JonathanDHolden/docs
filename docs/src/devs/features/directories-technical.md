# Directories

The LocalGov Directories module and it's sub-modules allows editors to create 'filterable' lists of content using a 'content-based' approach. In constrast with the traditional 'configuration-based' workflow, where developers\site-builders would need to combine Views; Taxonomies; Search API indexes and Facets and then deploy these via Configuration Sync, LocalGov directories allow editors to create new listing pages 'on-the-fly' as they would a Node or any other content.

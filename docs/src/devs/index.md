# For Developers

LocalGov Drupal is a distribution that has been developed collaboratively by Councils and suppliers for Councils. It comes with functionality that most local councils need for web publishing.

It will need some development resource to get it set up, configured for an individual councils needs, ready for launch and hosted and maintained going forward.

Many councils develop custom functionality for their sites, and we encourage them to contibute these back in to the project to allow other councils to benefit.

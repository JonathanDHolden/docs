# For Developers

This section is developer focused documentation. 

If you just want to get **set up locally** check out the section named "[Getting started](/devs/getting-started)" or check out the Git repos on [Github](https://github.com/localgovdrupal). 

There is **technical overviews** of the various features of LocalGov Drupal in the [Features](/devs/features) and [General Configuration](/devs/general/) section. 

**Frontend Developers** might like to check out the [Theme](/devs/theme) section. 

## Roadmap

Want to know what features are on the Roadmap? 
The Trello board maintained by the Product Group has features on the horizon. 

## Get involved

LocalGov Drupal needs developers to help push forward features and issues. If you are a developer in a council using or considering Localgov Drupal please get in touch!

We would also welcome contributions and support from agencies supporting councils using LocalGov Drupal.

### Technical Slack channel
The #technical-group #frontend slack channels are good places to find out who else is involved or ask for help. Get in touch with ( hello@localgovdrupal.org ) to join the slack channel. 

### Technical Drop In (Fortnightly Thursdays)

Keep an eye out for the details in the [LocalGov Drupal calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=dnkea9ec90vrkdnrmlo1ng3dik@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).

# Quality standards for LocalGov Drupal projects

We want to ensure that our projects meet high standard of quality, including
code, docuentation, testing and more.

Drupal core identifies a number of key gates that must apss before a module is
accepted into the Drupal core codebase.

For LocaGov Drupal, we aim to do the same. This policy is meant to be a
checklist for project maintainers to make sure the project meets the standards
our users have come to expect and rely upon.

# Development workflows

There are two main areas of development to consider.

1. Collaboration on the products within the open source Github organisation 
2. Installing, developing and deploying a site based on LocalGov Drupal or LocalGov Microsites. 

## Collaborating on Github

We encourage everyone to collaborate on Github to help improve the products, modules and themes we support. 
To help with this, we aim to follow a number of conventions and best practices.

1. [Code of conduct](https://localgovdrupal.org/resources/code-conduct)
2. [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/blob/2.x/CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. [Git branch naming conventions](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/wiki/Git-branch-naming-conventions)
4. [Module, project and field naming conventions](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/wiki/Naming-conventions)
5. [Reporting security issues](https://github.com/localgovdrupal/localgov/wiki/Security)


## Building and deploying your own site(s)

Since Drupal 8, the Drupal community has benefitted from composer to manage dependencies and configration management to manage the state of a Drupal site. This leads to different approaches to building and deploying your code and confugration and some challenges inherient in doning so consistenly.

# Managing content

Drupal distiguishes between configuraion and content. Content is generally not exportable from one site to another, whereas configuration is.

## How to find content

Visit the Conent Overview by:
- Admin menu > Content
- visit yourdomain.gov.uk/admin/content

This screen shows a tabbed interface defaulting to the Content pane. The other tabs allow you to see other kinds of content eg: Media, Facets, ... (todo)

The pane displays a table, with each row showing an item of content, with metadata displayed. You can sort the table by most of the table headings: Last updated date, Author, Published status.

You will see an Edit button in the Actions column for content that you have the permission to edit.

You can use the filers above the table to filter down the list of content.

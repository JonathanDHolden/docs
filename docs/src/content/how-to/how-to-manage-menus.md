# How to manage menus

// Depending on the configuration of your instance of LocalGov Drupal you may not have the permision to manage menus and menu items. Please discuss this with your site administrator. 

## Menu overview page.

Visit the Menu Overview by:

- navigating via Admin menu > Structure > Menus
- visit yourdomain.gov.uk/admin/structure/menus

This page shows a table of all the menus in use in the website, with a description of each and an Edit Menu button for each row. If you don't see an Edit Menu button it means you don't have permission to edit the menu. 

## Managing a menu

Click Manage Menus to see an outline of the menu items. 

The Menu table has a draggable interface which allows menu items to be reordered.

Use the crosshairs at the far left of the table to drag the items up, down, left and right.

Keyboard users can tab to the crosshair and use arrow keys to move an item up , down , left and right. 

Items indented to the right of another is a child item of the item above and left of it. 

If you can't see the crosshairs click the "Hide weights" button.

Click Save to keep the changes. 

### Weights

 If needed you can click the "Show weights" button which will allow you to reorder items based on numerical input.

Items appear in decending numerical order, with something with the weight of 5 appearing before something with the weight of 1. something wih the weight of -1 will appear after something with the weight of 1. 

Weight applies within siblings only, and will not affect parent / child / cousin weights.

# How to use Github

Github is the place we store and manange the code for the LocalGov Drupal project. We also use it to write this documentation, manage bugs and feature requests and run automated tests. 

Unless you are contributing code or documentation the main thing you might want to do is log and comment on issues in the issue queues. 

Watch the following session on how to use Github.

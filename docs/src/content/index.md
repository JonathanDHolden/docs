# Content designers

This section is specifically to help content designers get up and running with a LocalGov Drupal site.

We've consulted Content Designers along the way as we've designed features, so we hope that once you've got up and running that you'll find it easy and intuitive.

The following pages explain how the features work out-of-the-box, from a content designer or editor point of view. We recommend that you copy and extend them with your own in-house styles to make a full styleguide.

## Video series

We've put together a series of How-to videos which are here in the documentation or can be seen on the [LocalGov Drupal YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibxxY4DUV2pf70Py14VEbOeQUtgPXKAn).

## Starter pack 

If you'd like something to download and keep handy, there is also a ['Starter pack for content designers' Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VL3EHizQMujGPoDjGPq_-FYcCl44vYqmKM9bVV1OQPM/edit?usp=sharing)  that covers most of the basics of creating and managing content. 


## Drupal terminology

If you are not familiar with Drupal CMS, here as are some of the most common terms explained. 

**Content types**: content types are one of the main building blocks within a Drupal site; as the name suggests, content types hold content. However, different content types can hold different kinds of content; an event can hold information that is specific to a time, where a discussion can be used for people to talk. Most sites have multiple different content types.

**Node**: within Drupal, a node is a piece of content. All data stored via a content type is a node.

**Taxonomy**: The process of classifying content.

**Vocabulary**: A group of taxonomy terms to choose from when classifying content in a particular way, such as the list of all of the vendor categories on a farmers market site.

**Taxonomy term**: A term used to classify content, such as a tag or a category. See also Vocabulary.

**Menus**: collections of links; these links can be displayed as a list, as drop-down items, with graphics, etc, depending on how they are styled by the theme.

**Entity**: an entity is a piece of data within a Drupal site. Nodes, users, comments, and taxonomy are all entities; additionally, with custom code you can create new entity types if/when needed. You can also add fields to entities, which allows for things like detailed user profiles, or more sophisticated comment forms.

**Fields:** fields are used to store and display structured information. For example, on a user profile, you would want to create a "First" and "Last" name field to store normalized data; or, you would break an address down into individual fields to store the components of an address. There are also different types of fields; for example, things as varied as email addresses and pictures can be stored within fields, and this allows us to make some assumptions about the information stored in the field.

**Role**: A named set of permissions that can be applied to a user account.

**Permission**: The ability to perform some action on the site, such as editing a particular type of content, or viewing user profiles.

**User**: A person interacting with the site, either logged-in or anonymous.

## How to get involved

### Working Groups

We're keen to have content designers represented in the design and specification of new features. Please get in touch if you want to be involved.

### Slack channels

Join the LocalGov Drupal Slack channel if you would like to get involved.

There's even a channel for #content and occassional meetups of content designers. These are really good places to get help, share learnings ot request new features.

### Report bugs and issues

We encourage people to report bugs and issues in the Git repo. See the how-to.

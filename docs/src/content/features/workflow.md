### Creating a new draft of Published content

When we edit a piece of published content and save it as Draft or Ready for Review, the content remains published and creates a new revision.

The **Latest version** tab will show the new revision, whereas the View tab will allow you to see the Published version.

## Revision log

You can leave a comment in the Revision log to describe what is being changed in any given edit.

### Required revision log

An administrator can make the revision log required on a sitewide basis.

## Scheduling content

-- Coming soon --

Content can prepared in advance, and set to publish (or unpublish) at a particular time.

To see / manage the list of currently scheduled to change state visit

Visit **Admin > Content > Scheduled Transitions**

## Content lifecycle / Review date

-- Coming soon --

Content should be reviewed regularly to ensure that it is relevant and up to date. We can track these reviews using the **Review Date** feature.

When you create or edit a piece of content you will see the Review date panel in the sidebar.

When you make an edit you can choose whether to classify it as a "Content review" or not. By default this is set to false.

If it is a content review, you can set the date that the next review date is due.

When the next review is due, a revision of the content will appear in the "Needs Review" dashboard. The content will remain published.

Visit **Admin > Content > Needs review**

## Previews

### Responsive layout preview

At the top of the edit page, next to your account settings there is a button ("Layout preview") which allows you to preview how the content will look across a number of devices.

If you don't see this button talk to the site administrator.

### Preview Link

Depending on your permissions, you may also be able to generate a Preview link. This allows you to share a draft of a piece of content with another person for 1 week.

The preview can be viewed by anyone with the link, so caution should be taken when sharing unpublished content.

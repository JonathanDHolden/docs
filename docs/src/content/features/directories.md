## Terminology

Directories are made up from a collection of concepts. It's helpful to understand these before reading the rest of this documentation.

**Directory Facets**: A Directory Facet is an attribute by which end users can filter content by. For a Directory of car parks a each Item could be assigned a Facet for the _maximum stay_ such as 3 hours or 4 hours.

**Diretory Facets types**: Directory Facets types are collections of Directory Facets. Taking the example above the Type would be _Maximum stay_ which collects together all of the available durations, e.g. 3,4,5 hours.

**Directory Channel**:

A Directory Channel is the page where end-users can view and filter the Directory Items.

**Directory Item**:

An Directory Item is an individual piece of content which is available in a Directory Channel and thus can be filtered\searched.

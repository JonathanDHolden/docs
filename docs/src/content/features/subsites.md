# Subsites

## When to use a Subsite

Subsites are useful if you're creating content that:

* needs to be more visual, with photos and videos
* you need a more flexible layout
* needs to market or promote a service

You can create a campaign landing page, with links through to connecting pages, as well as an image banner, photos and videos. It is relatively easy to visually make the whole subsite look different to the rest of the site.

# Alert Banners
## Introduction
The LGD Alert Banner module provides alert banners that can be placed sitewide or on selected pages. The modules provides one predefined banner type named Alert banner, with four alert types: **Announcement, Minor Alert, Major Alert**, and **Death of a notable person**. 

Visitors can close individual alert banners, thereby preventing the banners from being displayed again. 

Editors can manage a number of different banners, and choose which ones are published at any given time.

Administrators can create additional banner types, and configure the alert types for each one. (learn more in the Configuration section)

Typical usage scenario:
* Administrator creates new alert type(s) for the Alert banner.
* Site editors create new banners, decide where and when all the banners are displayed.

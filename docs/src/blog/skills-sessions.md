# Check out our Skills Sessions

LocalGov Drupal is obviously about Drupal. But it's also about the tips and tricks we share as we're doing our jobs. We've all learned so much about creating a web publishing platform in the 21st century, and our Slack channel is often buzzing with conversations about content design, accessiblity, privacy and more.

So rather than keep this to ourselves, we've launched an occasional series called "Skills Sessions" on YouTube. Every few weeks we meet for an hour and look at a specific topic. Typically one person from our expanded team leads the session, but anyone can chip in.

## Follow along on YouTube

Our latest session explains Github and why it helps councils work together.

The LocalGov Drupal YouTube channel has this [not very friendly URL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgOTBrkZvJwCuODRpHxZIIA) so please like and subscribe so we can get a nice one. We need 100 subscribers to qualify and are almost half way there. Thanks.

## Future sessions

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/localgovdrupal) and we'll give you advance warning of events. We're using Google Meet so numbers might be limited from time to time.

Please let us know what you think of this video, and what you'd like us to cover.

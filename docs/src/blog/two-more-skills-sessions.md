# Skills Sessions - GDPR and Sociocracy

Our occasional series continued during May with two great Skills Sessions on GDPR and Sociocracy.

Regular readers will know that one or two people lead the session, but anyone can share their experiences and ask questions. We always end up having good conversations, and everyone learns something new.

We figured this might be useful for others, so are adding recordings of the sessions to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgOTBrkZvJwCuODRpHxZIIA).

## GDPR

[Mike King](https://twitter.com/emkay) and [Mark Conroy](https://twitter.com/markconroy) from Annertech have in depth knowledge of GDPR issues, and how to provide the best solution for citizens. We really liked how they walked through the important issues, and provided best practice examples. Thanks both!

## Sociocracy

What is Sociocracy? you ask. Well, it's a great way of organising a large team into smaller groups that are empowered to make good decisions. As LocalGov Drupal grows, it's something we need to better understand and do. 

[Finn Lewis](https://twitter.com/finnlewis) from Agile Collective and [Abi Handley](https://twitter.com/choccybic) from Outlandish explain more. Like our other videos, it's well worth a watch. Thanks Finn and Abi for your talk!

## Help us get a short YouTube URL!

The LocalGov Drupal YouTube channel has this [not very friendly URL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgOTBrkZvJwCuODRpHxZIIA) so please like and subscribe so we can get a nice one. We need 100 subscribers to qualify and are over half way there. Thanks.

## Future sessions

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/localgovdrupal) and we'll give you advance warning of events. We're using Google Meet so numbers might be limited from time to time.

Please let us know what you think of this video, and what you'd like us to cover.
